## Composition is better than inheritance ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸/ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§
[YouTube vpTech Channel](https://youtu.be/-AeaLKXQ7BA)

I try to answer a question about **why composition is better than inheritance**. I show troubles with inheritance and propose a solution using functional composition. Then to make it less verbose I introduce more common operator like `|>` pipe forward and `>>>` forward function composition.
